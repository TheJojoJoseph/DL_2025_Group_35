        "The telecommunications industry is a rapidly growing sector that is constantly evolving to meet the demands of consumers. As technology advances and user behavior changes, telecom operators face a variety of challenges that can impact their business success. In order to stay competitive and meet customer needs, it is important for telecom companies to regularly analyze their data to identify relevant problems and opportunities for improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Project is part of the \"telecom data\" cluster of projects, targeting the telecom industry. It is recommended to go through the [\"Exploratory Data Analysis\"](https://www.projectpro.io/data-science-use-cases/telecom-data-analysis-project) notebook before executing this project to understand the Data better.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Aim:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The aim of a churn prediction notebook is to develop a machine learning model that can predict which customers are likely to churn or discontinue their use of a service or product. Churn prediction is a critical business problem for companies that operate on a subscription or recurring revenue model, such as telecommunications companies.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the project will involve building a churn prediction model, the primary focus will be on the importance of monitoring and adapting to changes in the data that may affect the accuracy and effectiveness of the model over time. The project will also emphasize the need for a feedback loop that allows for continuous improvement and refinement of the model based on new data and changing business requirements. By highlighting these concepts, the project aims to help businesses understand the importance of staying agile and adaptable in their machine learning approaches, rather than solely focusing on the accuracy of a single model.\n",

        "\n",
        "Churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to discontinue using a service or product. In the context of the telecom sector, churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to switch to a competitor or terminate their contract with their current service provider.\n",
        "\n",
        "Churn prediction is a critical problem in the telecom sector, as it has a significant impact on a service provider's revenue and profitability. The telecom sector is highly competitive, and service providers are constantly vying for customers' attention. It helps service providers identify customers who are at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenges**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Churn prediction is a challenging problem, as it involves analyzing large volumes of data from multiple sources. Telecom service providers generate a vast amount of data from customer interactions, network performance, and billing systems. This data is typically stored in disparate systems, making it difficult to analyze and derive insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Another challenge in churn prediction is the diversity of customer behavior. Customers have different reasons for leaving a service provider, and these reasons can be difficult to predict. Some customers may leave due to poor network performance, while others may switch to a competitor offering a better deal. Predicting churn accurately requires understanding these different customer behaviors and identifying the most critical predictors of churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business Impact of Churn Prediction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Churn prediction has a significant impact on a telecom service provider's business. A high churn rate can result in a loss of revenue and profitability. On the other hand, an effective churn prediction model can help service providers identify customers who are at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some of the key business impacts of churn prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Revenue Protection**: Churn prediction helps service providers protect their revenue by identifying customers who are likely to leave and taking proactive measures to retain them. This can include offering discounts, upgrading service plans, or providing additional services. By retaining customers, service providers can maintain their revenue stream and avoid the cost of acquiring new customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Customer Retention**: Churn prediction helps service providers retain their existing customers by identifying their needs and preferences. By understanding why customers leave, service providers can make improvements to their service and provide a better customer experience. This can help to build customer loyalty and increase the lifetime value of a customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Cost Reduction**: Churn prediction can help service providers reduce the cost of acquiring new customers. Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones, and churn prediction can help service providers focus their marketing efforts on the most valuable customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Competitive Advantage**: Churn prediction can provide a significant competitive advantage in the telecom sector. By retaining customers and improving the customer experience, service providers can differentiate themselves from their competitors. This can help to increase market share and profitability.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **NumPy**: The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today. NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more. Refer to [documentation](https://numpy.org/) for more information. pandas and NumPy are together used for most of the data analysis and manipulation in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Refer to [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/) for more information.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Warnings**:The warnings library provides a way to handle warnings that are generated during program execution. Warnings are typically issued when there is a potential issue with code, but the code still runs without errors. The warnings module provides a way to catch these warnings and handle them in a way that is appropriate for the program. This can be especially useful when developing and debugging code, as warnings can help identify potential issues before they become errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **sys**:The sys library provides access to some system-specific parameters and functions. This library can be used to access system-level information, such as the command line arguments passed to the program, the version of the Python interpreter being used, and more.\n",

Data exploration is important because it helps to provide a solid foundation for subsequent data analysis tasks, hypothesis testing and data visualization.\n",

Knowing the dimensions of the dataset is important to understand the amount of data available for analysis and to determine the feasibility of different methods of analysis.\n",

        "* Head: The head function is used to display the top five rows of the dataset. It helps us to understand the structure and organization of the dataset. This function gives an idea of what data is present in the dataset, what the column headers are, and how the data is organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Tail: The tail function is used to display the bottom five rows of the dataset. It provides the same information as the head function but for the bottom rows. The tail function is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it can be time-consuming to scroll through all the rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Describe: The describe function provides a summary of the numerical columns in the dataset. It includes the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values, as well as the quartiles. It helps to understand the distribution of the data, the presence of any outliers, and potential issues that can affect the model's accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Isnull: The isnull function is used to identify missing values in the dataset. It returns a Boolean value for each cell, indicating whether it is null or not. This function is useful to identify the presence of missing data, which can be problematic for regression analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dropna: The dropna function is used to remove rows or columns with missing data. It is used to remove any observations or variables with missing data, which can lead to biased results in the regression analysis. The dropna function is used after identifying the missing data with the isnull function.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Columns: The .columns method is a built-in function that is used to display the column names of a pandas DataFrame or Series. It returns an array-like object that contains the names of the columns in the order in which they appear in the original DataFrame or Series. It can be used to obtain a quick overview of the variables in a dataset and their names."

        "\n",
        "Outlier detection is a critical data analysis technique that involves identifying and removing data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Outliers are data points that lie far away from the rest of the data, and they can significantly influence the statistical analysis and machine learning models' performance. Therefore, identifying and removing outliers is essential to ensure accurate and reliable data analysis results.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main approaches for outlier detection: parametric and non-parametric.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Parametric Methods:\n",
        "Parametric methods assume that the data follows a specific distribution, such as a normal distribution. In this approach, outliers are identified by calculating the distance of each data point from the mean of the distribution in terms of the number of standard deviations. Data points that are beyond a certain number of standard deviations (usually three or more) are considered as outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "One common parametric method is the Z-score method, which calculates the distance of each data point from the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n",
        "Parametric methods can be useful when the data follows a known distribution, but they may not be effective when the data is not normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Non-Parametric Methods:\n",
        "Non-parametric methods do not assume any specific distribution of the data. Instead, they rely on the rank or order of the data points. In this approach, outliers are identified by comparing the values of each data point with the values of other data points. Data points that are significantly different from other data points are considered as outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantiles are an important concept in non-parametric outlier detection methods. They represent values that divide a dataset into equal-sized parts, such as quarters or thirds. The most commonly used quantiles are the median (which divides the data into two equal parts), the first quartile (which divides the data into the lowest 25% and the highest 75%), and the third quartile (which divides the data into the lowest 75% and the highest 25%).\n",
        "\n",
        "The interquartile range (IQR) is another important concept related to quantiles. It is defined as the difference between the third and first quartiles and represents the middle 50% of the data. The IQR can be used to identify outliers by defining a range (known as the Tukey's fence) beyond which any data points are considered outliers.\n",
        "Non-parametric methods can be useful when the data is not normally distributed or when the distribution is unknown."

For instance, the 0.25 quantile is the value below which 25% of the observations fall and the 0.75 quantile is the value below which 75% of the observations fall. By calculating quantiles at various levels, we can get a better understanding of the distribution of the data and identify any observations that are too far away from the rest of the data.\n",

        "Missing Values: Identified missing values in total_rech_data and Internet Type.\n",
        "total_rech_data: Initially, about 32% of values were missing. It was observed that these missing values correlated with 'Not Applicable' values in arpu_4g and arpu_5g. These were filled with 0 for 'Not Applicable' ARPU cases, and the mean of total_rech_data for other cases.\n",

        "Both models achieved high accuracy (around 95.8-95.9%), which is expected given the imbalanced dataset (low churn rate).\n",
        "The ANN model showed better Recall (0.1441) and F1-Score (0.2422) compared to the 1D CNN (Recall: 0.1047, F1-Score: 0.1862) for identifying churned customers.\n",
        "The CNN had slightly higher Precision (0.8383 vs 0.7589), meaning when it predicted churn, it was more often correct.\n",
        "The ROC-AUC scores for both models were relatively low (around 0.55-0.57), indicating that while they are good at predicting non-churn, their ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn cases across all thresholds is not very strong.\n",
        "The bar chart visually summarized these performance metrics, highlighting the trade-offs between the two models on different metrics. The dataset's class imbalance (only ~4.57% churn) suggests that metrics like Recall and F1-Score are more critical than overall accuracy for this problem."
