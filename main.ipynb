        "## Executive Summary\n",
        "This project successfully developed, trained, and compared deep learning models (ANN and 1D CNN) to predict customer churn in the telecom sector using US telecom data (653,753 rows × 74 columns). The goal was to identify customers likely to discontinue service to enable targeted retention campaigns. Despite a severe class imbalance (4.57% churn rate), the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) achieved the best overall performance, with 95.9% accuracy and a Recall of 0.1441, indicating superior ability to detect actual churners compared to the CNN. Key business insights highlight high ARPU customers and specific data usage patterns as major churn risk factors.\n",

        "\n",
        "While the project will involve building a churn prediction model, the primary focus will be on the importance of monitoring and adapting to changes in the data that may affect the accuracy and effectiveness of the model over time. The project will also emphasize the need for a feedback loop that allows for continuous improvement and refinement of the model based on new data and changing business requirements. By highlighting these concepts, the project aims to help businesses understand the importance of staying agile and adaptable in their machine learning approaches, rather than solely focusing on the accuracy of a single model.\n",

        "\n",
        "Churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to discontinue using a service or product. In the context of the telecom sector, churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to switch to a competitor or terminate their contract with their current service provider.\n",
        "\n",
        "Churn prediction is a critical problem in the telecom sector, as it has a significant impact on a service provider's revenue and profitability. The telecom sector is highly competitive, and service providers are constantly vying for customers' attention. It helps service providers identify customers who are at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenges**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Churn prediction is a challenging problem, as it involves analyzing large volumes of data from multiple sources. Telecom service providers generate a vast amount of data from customer interactions, network performance, and billing systems. This data is typically stored in disparate systems, making it difficult to analyze and derive insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Another challenge in churn prediction is the diversity of customer behavior. Customers have different reasons for leaving a service provider, and these reasons can be difficult to predict. Some customers may leave due to poor network performance, while others may switch to a competitor offering a better deal. Predicting churn accurately requires understanding these different customer behaviors and identifying the most critical predictors of churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business Impact of Churn Prediction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Churn prediction has a significant impact on a telecom service provider's business. A high churn rate can result in a loss of revenue and profitability. On the other hand, an effective churn prediction model can help service providers identify customers who are at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some of the key business impacts of churn prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Revenue Protection**: Churn prediction helps service providers protect their revenue by identifying customers who are likely to leave and taking proactive measures to retain them. This can include offering discounts, upgrading service plans, or providing additional services. By retaining customers, service providers can maintain their revenue stream and avoid the cost of acquiring new customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Customer Retention**: Churn prediction helps service providers retain their existing customers by identifying their needs and preferences. By understanding why customers leave, service providers can make improvements to their service and provide a better customer experience. This can help to build customer loyalty and increase the lifetime value of a customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Cost Reduction**: Churn prediction can help service providers reduce the cost of acquiring new customers. Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones, and churn prediction can help service providers focus their marketing efforts on the most valuable customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Competitive Advantage**: Churn prediction can provide a significant competitive advantage in the telecom sector. By retaining customers and improving the customer experience, service providers can differentiate themselves from their competitors. This can help to increase market share and profitability.\n",

It returns an array-like object that contains the names of the columns in the order in which they appear in the original DataFrame or Series. It can be used to obtain a quick overview of the variables in a dataset and their names."

        "\n",
        "Outlier detection is a critical data analysis technique that involves identifying and removing data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Outliers are data points that lie far away from the rest of the data, and they can significantly influence the statistical analysis and machine learning models' performance. Therefore, identifying and removing outliers is essential to ensure accurate and reliable data analysis results.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main approaches for outlier detection: parametric and non-parametric.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Parametric Methods:\n",
        "Parametric methods assume that the data follows a specific distribution, such as a normal distribution. In this approach, outliers are identified by calculating the distance of each data point from the mean of the distribution in terms of the number of standard deviations. Data points that are beyond a certain number of standard deviations (usually three or more) are considered as outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "One common parametric method is the Z-score method, which calculates the distance of each data point from the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n",
        "Parametric methods can be useful when the data follows a known distribution, but they may not be effective when the data is not normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Non-Parametric Methods:\n",
        "Non-parametric methods do not assume any specific distribution of the data. Instead, they rely on the rank or order of the data points. In this approach, outliers are identified by comparing the values of each data point with the values of other data points. Data points that are significantly different from other data points are considered as outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantiles are an important concept in non-parametric outlier detection methods. They represent values that divide a dataset into equal-sized parts, such as quarters or thirds. The most commonly used quantiles are the median (which divides the data into two equal parts), the first quartile (which divides the data into the lowest 25% and the highest 75%), and the third quartile (which divides the data into the lowest 75% and the highest 25%).\n",
        "\n",
        "The interquartile range (IQR) is another important concept related to quantiles. It is defined as the difference between the third and first quartiles and represents the middle 50% of the data. The IQR can be used to identify outliers by defining a range (known as the Tukey's fence) beyond which any data points are considered outliers.\n",
        "Non-parametric methods can be useful when the data is not normally distributed or when the distribution is unknown."

For instance, the 0.25 quantile is the value below which 25% of the observations fall and the 0.75 quantile is the value below which 75% of the observations fall. By calculating quantiles at various levels, we can get a better understanding of the distribution of the data and identify any observations that are too far away from the rest of the data.\n",

This will allow them to adjust their strategies and improve their customer retention efforts.\n",

        "TabNet offers several advantages for this telecom churn prediction task:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Interpretability**: Unlike traditional neural networks, TabNet provides feature importance scores that help understand which customer attributes drive churn decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Efficient Feature Selection**: The sequential attention mechanism automatically selects relevant features at each decision step, reducing noise from irrelevant features.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Tabular Data Optimization**: Specifically designed for tabular data, TabNet often outperforms general-purpose neural networks on structured datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **No Feature Engineering Required**: TabNet can handle both categorical and numerical features natively without extensive preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Hyperparameters:**\n",
        "- `n_d` and `n_a`: Control the width of decision and attention layers\n",
        "- `n_steps`: Number of sequential decision steps (higher = more complex reasoning)\n",
        "- `gamma`: Controls feature reusage across steps\n",
        "- `lambda_sparse`: Sparsity regularization for interpretability\n",

        "The CNN had slightly higher Precision (0.8383 vs 0.7589), meaning when it predicted churn, it was more often correct.\n",
        "The ROC-AUC scores for both models were relatively low (around 0.55-0.57), indicating that while they are good at predicting non-churn, their ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn cases across all thresholds is not very strong.\n",
        "The bar chart visually summarized these performance metrics, highlighting the trade-offs between the two models on different metrics. The dataset's class imbalance (only ~4.57% churn) suggests that metrics like Recall and F1-Score are more critical than overall accuracy for this problem."
